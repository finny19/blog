In this weeks lab, I started to work on something almost completely different from any other labs. In the past, we have been using static site generators on github (like the one this blog is on), but in this one we used razor pages and dotNet.

For this new lab, you can now interactively change the data on the web page, but only in the confines of what the application allows. That means that for the practice, I can add new movies to a database with a title, genre, price, and rating. For the one I did, that means I can add a new monster to a database with their name, type, and level.

This is the github code for my [monster site](https://github.com/finny19/csci340lab8). All in all, this was a pretty fun lab for me but of course I faced a few challenges. It was brand new to me, and I additionally became really sick in between the [tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-7.0) and my own page, which made it harder to remember what I should be doing.

I did prevail though, and I think the tutorial ended up easier for me because I am stubborn and use terminal for all my github needs (we had to use terminal for a lot of this stuff). I do think the tutorial could have been more clear at times, sometimes it told me to replace code *somewhere* but it wouldn't tell me *exactly where*.

As for translating the tutorial into my own site, other than not remembering how the tutorial went because my body and brain staged a colaborative coup, it wasn't that hard code-wise. In all honesty, the hardest part was deciding what to do it about. If you know from my interests page, I like bread clips a lot, and initially wanted to have it be about breadclips... but that's super complicated. So while looking around for inspiration, there it was, the *Monster Manual*!!

I'm pretty confident with any razor pages stuff I may (**will**) have to do in the future. It looks really similar also to how the blog originally lookes (see Lab 2 post). I can't really remeber any other similarities I cam across though...

Lastly, like always, I am excited for the future of this class. Thanks for reading!!
