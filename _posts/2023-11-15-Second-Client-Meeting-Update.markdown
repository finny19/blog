At this point in time, I have now been a part of a group in my class that is working with a client to make a database website that will suit her needs. Our group is working on the ISeeGreen (ISG) project for Dr. Ann Willyard. We have now met with her a second time to show off some mockups of what we think the website should look like, and she also thinks that what we have so far looks good. We'll stick with a green-color scheme and have multiple images of plants on the site. 

As of now, I still haven't done any of the coding but that will soon change. We have decided that Kate and Simon, my partners, will be working on searching and the database respectively. As for me, for now I will just be offering support since we can't really do much until thats done. It's been a lot of work, but I'm excited.
